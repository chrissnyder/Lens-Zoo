    <h2>Gravitational Lensing</h2>
    <p>Einstein's theory of gravity, General Relativity, made a remarkable prediction. Massive objects, such as stars, would bend the space around them such that passing light rays follow curved paths. Evidence for this revolutionary theory was first obtained by Arthur Eddington in 1919, when during a solar eclipse he observed that stars near the edge of the Sun appeared to be slightly out of position. The Sun was behaving like the lens in a magnifying glass and bending the light from the background stars!</p>
  
    <p>In 1937,  Fritz Zwicky realized that massive galaxies (which can contain anywhere from ten million to a hundred trillion stars) or clusters of galaxies could be used to magnify distant galaxies that conventional telescopes couldn’t detect.
    
    As you can see, not unlike a conventional magnifying glass, these gravitational lenses not only magnify and focus the light of the distant background galaxies but they can, and mostly do, distort them as well.</p>
  
    <p>When one of these gravitational lenses happens to sit right in front of a background galaxy, the magnification factor can be up to x10 or even more, giving us a zoomed-in view of the distant universe, just at that particular point. Lenses can help us investigate young galaxies more than halfway across the universe, as they formed stars and started to take on the familiar shapes we see nearby.</p>
  
    <p>Observations of the distorted background galaxy can also give us useful information about the object that is behaving as a gravitational lens. The separation and distortion of the lensed images can tell astronomers how much mass there is in the object, and how it is arranged. It’s one of the few ways we have of mapping out where the dark matter in the universe is, how clumpy it is and how dense it is near the centers of galaxies. Knowing this can provide crucial information about how galaxies evolve.</p>
  
    <h2>Needles in a Haystack</h2>
    <p>There is a lot of interesting science to be done with gravitational lenses. The problem is that they are very rare. Only about one in a thousand massive galaxies is aligned with a background object well enough to cause it to appear multiply-imaged. We currently know of about 400 objects that are behaving as gravitational lenses, largely because we have become very good at observing the night sky! Modern optical surveys cover thousands of square degrees, with images sharp and deep enough to resolve about 1 lens per square degree. There should be thousands of lenses that we can detect, but we will need to look at millions of galaxy images to find them!</p>
  
    <p>The ideal solution would be to get a computer to look through all of the images, but unfortunately this is not a straightforward solution. Teaching a computer to recognize the effects of gravitational lensing is not too difficult, but they can be easily confused by galaxies that look very similar to a distorted background galaxy. Also in order for the computer to run fast enough to analyse lots of images quickly, they have to cut a lot of corners, and this makes them less effective.</p>

    <h2>Discovering Lenses: a Human-Computer Partnership</h2>
    <p>Human beings have a remarkable ability to recognise patterns and detect the unusual with only minimal training.  With a basic understanding of what the distorted images of galaxies that have passed through a gravitational lens look like, participants in the SpaceWarps project can help discover new examples of this amazing phenomenon, and enable our survey scientists to carry out new investigations of stars and dark matter  in the universe. We will be doing two types of lens search. In our blind searches, we’ll be asking volunteers to spot signs of gravitational lensing in images of the sky taken as part of the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) legacy survey. This survey has been searched by computers, but we’re pretty sure they didn’t catch all the lenses to be found! These results will help us re-train the computers to do better on larger surveys in future. Then, in our targeted searches, in other upcoming sky surveys, we’ll be showing participants galaxies and groups of galaxies that our computers have selected as possibly being gravitational lenses.  The task will then be to assess whether or not they actually are! In both cases, there will be confusing objects around - the challenge is to come up with the most plausible explanation for what is going on, in collaboration with the rest of the SpaceWarps community. Do you think you can spot outer space being warped?  We do!</p>

      <p>Phil is an astronomer at the University of Oxford Physics department. After deciding he liked doing maths and physics problems at school and university enough to want to make up his own questions, Phil did a PhD at Cambridge University on using gravitational lensing to map the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters. He then did several postdoctoral research jobs in California, using strong lenses to weigh galaxies, and investigating automated strong lens detection. He knows very well how hard it is to teach a robot to spot lenses - or at least, how hard it is to teach them not to be confused by large numbers of galaxies that are not lenses.</p>

      <p>Aprajita is an astronomer at the University of Oxford, and previously worked at Imperial College London and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (Germany). She became fascinated by gravitational lenses during her PhD in which she studied some of the most luminous galaxies seen in the Universe, some of which have been gravitationally lensed. Aprajita is interested in making use of gravitational lenses as natural telescopes to study the galaxies that are being lensed in more detail than would normally be possible, as well as measuring the light and dark matter in the lensing galaxies themselves. Having worked with citizen scientists looking for gravitational lenses in Galaxy Zoo, she was inspired by their efforts, motivating the emergence of Space Warps.</p>

      <p>Anupreeta is a JSPS postdoctoral fellow at the Kavli IPMU in the University of Tokyo (Todai). She has been captivated by gravitational lenses ever since she first saw one. She likes to find these rare systems and study them to learn more about the mysterious dark matter and how it influences the galaxies hosted within. She's interested in developing better algorithms to find lens systems automatically in order to solve the "needle in a haystack" problem. She’s leading the first Space Warps project using data from the CFHT Legacy Survey. With the help of citizen scientists, she can find the lenses that were missed by her arc-finding algorithm which will help her improve the algorithm. This will be extremely useful when doing lens searches with future large imaging surveys.</p>

      <p>Els has always been interested in science, and astronomy in particular, but choices and career moves steered her in a very different direction. So, when she discovered GalaxyZoo, it was the chance of a lifetime to get seriously involved. This resulted in, among other things, moderating the discussion in several different projects (Solar StormWatch, Old Weather, IceHunters and recently for GalaxyZoo Talk) and classifying in many more. Before GalaxyZoo came along she had only some vague notions of what a gravitational lens was, but she quickly became intrigued by them and spent hours searching the SDSS images for potential lenses. She is looking forward to doing some serious lens hunting!</p>
