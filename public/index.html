            <h1>Lenses are very rare.</h1>
          
            <h2>Gravitational Lensing</h2>
            <p>Einstein's theory of gravity, General Relativity, made a remarkable prediction. Massive objects, like galaxies or clusters of galaxies, should bend the space around them such that passing light rays follow curved paths: they behave like "gravitational lenses," focusing the light and distorting and magnifying the images of distant galaxies in the background. When one of these spacewarps happens to sit right in front of a background galaxy, the magnification factor can be upto 10 times or more, giving us a zoomed-in view of the distant universe, just at that particular point. Lenses can help us investigate young galaxies more than halfway across the universe, as they formed stars and started to take on the familiar shapes we see nearby.
  </p>
            <p>As well as being useful as cosmic telescopes, gravitational lenses can be used to weigh the galaxy or cluster that is warping the space: with high magnification comes multiple images of the background galaxy, arranged around the image of the deflector. The separation and distortion of the lensed images contains information about how much mass there is in the lens, and how it is arranged: it's one of the few ways we have of mapping out where the dark matter in the universe is. How clumpy the dark matter is, and how dense it is near the centers of galaxies, can tell us about how galaxies evolve, and perhaps even what the dark matter is.</p>
            <h2>Needles in a Haystack</h2>
            <p>
            There is a lot of interesting science to be done with gravitational lenses. The problem is that they are very rare. Only about one in a thousand massive galaxies is aligned with a background object well enough to cause it to appear multiply-imaged. We know of about 400 gravitational lenses now, largely because we have become very good at observing the night sky! Modern optical surveys cover thousands of square degrees, with images sharp and deep enough to resolve about 1 lens per square degree, and that should contain millions of massive galaxies, and so thousands of lenses. All we need to do is find them!</p>
            <p>
            This is not as easy as it sounds: teaching a computer to recognize the effects of gravitational lensing is not too difficult (although there are some exceptions, overall we understand the patterns of images produced by spacewarps very well), but our robots are easily confused by galaxies that look like lens systems even though they are just galaxies. And for them to run fast on lots of imaging data, they have to cut a lot of corners, and this makes them less effective.</p>
          
            <h2>Discovering Lenses: a Human-Robot Partnership</h2>
            <p>With some understanding of what gravitational lenses do, you can help discover new examples of this amazing phenomenon, and enable our survey scientists to carry out new investigations of stars and dark matter galaxies in the universe. We will be doing two types of lens search. In our blind searches, we'll be asking you to spot signs of gravitational lensing in images of the sky taken as part of the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) legacy survey. This survey has been searched by robots, but we're pretty sure they didn't catch all the lenses to be found! And your results will help us re-train the robots to do better on larger surveys in future. Then, in our targeted searches, in other upcoming sky surveys, we'll be showing you galaxies and groups of galaxies that our robots have selected as possibly being lenses; your task will be to assess whether or not they actually are! In both cases, there will be confusing objects around - the challenge is to come up with the most plausible explanation for what is going on, in collaboration with the rest of the SpaceWarps community. Do you think you can spot outer space being warped?  We do!</p>

            <p>This quasar has been lensed into four images, arranged around the galaxy. This is called the Einstein cross configuration. Quads are about 6 times rarer than doubles.</p>

            <p>This faint blue galaxy is being magnified and distorted into an arc by the massive red galaxy. See how the arc curves around the lens. If you look closely there is a hint of a counter-image (a second image opposite side of the lens to the primary arc). It is the same colour as the primary arc but it is typically fainter. Because of this sometimes the counter image is bright enough to be seen but sometimes it's too faint to be seen.</p>

            <p>In the very rare instance that a background galaxy is (almost perfectly) aligned to the foreground galaxy along the line of sight to us, the light of the background galaxy is deflected in all directions. This give rise to a ring-like lensed image and is called an Einstein Ring.</p>

            <p>Groups or clusters of massive red galaxies can lens background galaxies into long, bright arcs. These arcs are typically less curved and at larger separations from the lensing galaxies than would be seen for a single lensing galaxy. This is because groups and clusters of galaxies are much more massive than a single galaxy and so the deflection of the image (or separation) can be larger.
